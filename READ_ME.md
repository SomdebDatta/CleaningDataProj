# Getting And Cleaning Data
This repository was created for the purpose of peer graded project of the Getting and Cleaning Data course (Week 4) for Coursera

# Project Summary
The aim of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

Here are the data for the project:

The RScript run_analysis.R does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

# Repository Information
